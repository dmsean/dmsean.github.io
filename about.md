### Me

Some days, I'm a Ruby and JavaScript/TypeScript developer. I enjoy programming
and I'm happy when I'm creating something useful. I'm most at home in the
back-end. All of my personal projects will be in Ruby or TypeScript, and will
be void of any major design elements. 

Other days, I'm something of a DevOps Engineer. I like anything to do with
data and automation. If there's something that my wife and kids do that I can
graph, I want to graph it. If there's something that they do that I can
automate, I want to automate it. A lot of my personal projects will fall into
those two categories.

### The Site

This site is intended to be a place to talk about some or all of the personal
projects that I work on. The goal is to provide a description, some of the
thoughts behind them, screenshots, etc. I hope you enjoy reading about them
as much as I enjoy working on them.

This site is built with Jekyll and deployed to GitHub pages. More information
can be found at [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and
[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).
