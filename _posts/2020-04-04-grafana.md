I mentioned in the previous post that I'm quite interested in collecting and
displaying metrics, and that I use Timescale to do that. In this post I'll talk 
a little bit about [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana), which I use to display
these various metrics.

I chose Grafana because it was the the most common platform that I saw included
with InfluxDB. There were alternatives, some of which were in some ways better,
like [Chronograf](https://github.com/influxdata/chronograf), which integrated
nicely with InfluxDB. I liked the layout of Grafana better, and I liked that
it had the ability to add multiple data sources. Most importantly, I chose
Grafana because it had started to be used at the job I worked at, and I wanted
to improve my skills in using it. 

_Side note: Using something at home is the best way to improve at something,
hands down. I don't believe in reading tutorials. I am a firm believer in having
a problem that you want to solve, and figuring out how to solve it. Generally,
having that problem at home means you're doing something that interest you,
which will make the process very smooth. Find something you want to do and just
do it._

_A graph showing a full week of temperatures from a few sensors around the
house._

Above is an example of one of the graphs I've created to display data from some
home automation lights and sensors around the house. I'll provide some more
detail about these in a future post. The purpose of these graphs is often mixed,
but in the case of these sensors, I like to see historical data and trends.
We're a family of iPhones here, so I can see the _current_ state at a glance
using Apple Home, but that doesn't help me when I want to see what the
temperature of say, the lounge room was earlier in the day. 

To get a feel for how I like to use this data, take a look at the above graph.
Firstly, the graph is an overview of a recent Monday to Friday. We can glean
some interesting information at a glance. For example, we can see that the
outside temperature (Backyard) deviates much more than the inside temperatures
(Lounge and Master Bedroom). If we take a closer look at a day, like 31/3, we
can see that it's a warm day, and there are some interesting things happening.
Here's another graph, showing a closer view of the 31/3, so we can delve into 
these interesting things.

_A close up version of the previous graph, showing more of the 31/3._

Looking at the close up of the 31/3, we can see that the outside temperature
starts to warm up at 8am, rises reasonably quickly until it peaks at about 3pm,
and then declines slowly until (presumably) 8am the next day. We can also see
that the Master Bedroom is consistently warmer than the Lounge room, and both
trend similarly throughout the day. Lastly, we can see that the Master Bedroom
declines rapidly at around 10:45pm when I put the air conditioner on, until it
comes back up an hour later and remains pretty consistent for the remaining time. 

Thanks to the magic of regular old SQL, I could easily join this data up with 
data from another table, like the ambient light in a room or any open doors and
windows. In general, all this information has been useful in answering questions
like: 

* How long would it take to heat the room with the small gas heater?
* How long would it take to cool or heat the room with the air conditioner?
* What impact does opening the front or back doors have on the Lounge room
  temperature?
* How much impact does the sun on an exterior wall have on the temperature of a
  room?
  
I'm always on the lookout for new and interesting things to graph. Temperature
is just one of these interesting things, and I will likely provide some more
detail about many of the other things in the future.
